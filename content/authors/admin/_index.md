Geo-Data science | Open Data  | Environmental science | Geo-statistics | Maps | GIS | Geo-spatial Analysis | Geo-visualization

I am a vagabond in the world of hypertext, a specialist in drifting in wikipedia pages and in labyrinths of knowledge. 
I have spent a large part of my life reading and learning. Whenever, I discover a new field, a concept, a study I find myself obliged to learn all the knowledge necessary to find out more. And since everything is interconnected, I mostly learned to get lost in the complex knowledge networks.
So I decided to write about what I read, to structure these information, to leave written traces of it and to share my summaries. Hence the genesis of this website.

I am interested in all areas of knowledge. But it is often the spatial dimension that appeals to me. Unconsciously, I try to spatialize everything, to represent the phenomena on a map, to study its geometries, its distances, its projections…

During my studies and work experiences, I explored various facets of space:

- **Architecture and urbanism**: building design, Urban planning, Generative design, Building Iformation Modelling (BIM)
- **Environmental and Cognitive Psychology**: Spatial cognition, Environmental perception, Mental maps, Decision-making
- **Social Geography**: Cartography, Socio-environmental systems, Human mobility, Agent-based modelling
- **Environmental science**: Natural hazards, geophysical modelling, hydro-meteorology, climatology
- **Geo-statistics**: kriging, Aggregation, Disaggregation, Simulation, Sampling
- **Geo-Data science and engineering**: Geospatial data collecting and cleaning, Spatial database modelling and data storage, Geo-visualization, Big data frameworks
