Passionate about Data Science and Product Ownership, I have experience in building and industrializing advanced data science products.

I have strong scientific background (Phd in Geo-science), and I worked on differents data science projects in academia (mobility pattern recognition, decision-making modeling with Bayesian networks, risk assessment...) and startups (Location intelligence, Smart building, IOTs, Data Quality Management and anomaly detection, Data Anonymization…).

Interested by the development of data science products within Agile framework organisation, I managed the design, deployment and monitoring of Location Intelligence and smart Building analytics tools within Big Data framework:
- Defining product roadmap and strategies
- Feature prioritisation based on client’s needs
- Specification and industrialisation of data processing modules: data integration, data profiling and cleaning, anomaly detection, data anonymization, aggregation and KPIs measuring, clustering, forecasting, alerting, reporting and data visualisation
- Documentation and communication about product features
